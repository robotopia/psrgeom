/*****************************************************************************
 * A source file for the library "psrgeom", which includes structs and
 * functions for treating pulsar geometry.
 *
 * Author: Sam McSweeney
 * Date  : 2018
 *
 * Description:
 *   This source file implements the functions required to find the emission
 *   locations for a given rotation phase. It uses a Nelder-Mead algorithm to
 *   converge on the desired point. The cost function incorporates both how
 *   close a point's field line is to the last open field line, and how
 *   close the emission direction is to the line of sight.

double psr_cost_lofl( point *X, pulsar *psr )
/* This calculates the "cost" associated with how close X's magnetic field
 * line is to a last open field line. Because the field lines behave
 * erratically outside the light cylinder, it is impractical to always find
 * the line's most distant point (i.e. perp. dist. from the z-axis) and
 * use that in the calculation. Therefore, we break the problem up into two
 * cases:
 *   1) the field line extends beyond the light cylinder,
 *   2) the field line is closed (within the light cylinder)
 * In the first case, we find the point at which the field line penetrates the
 * light cylinder and use the "B dot r_{xy}" quantity as a proxy for the cost.
 * In the second case, we use fractional distance of the most extreme point to
 * the light cylinder as a proxy for the cost.
 *
 * Inputs:
 *   point *X    : The point whose cost we want to evaluate
 *   pulsar *psr : The pulsar whose magnetic field we want to use for the
 *                 calculation
 * Return value:
 *   cost        : The cost of the point X. It is guaranteed to be a number
 *                 between 0 and 1, where 0 means that X is on a last open
 *                 field line.
